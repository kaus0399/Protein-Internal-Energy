# Protein-Internal-Energy
Project for UC Davis ECS 129 2020 By Kaustubh Deshpande
https://web.cs.ucdavis.edu/~koehl/Teaching/ECS129/projects.html



# PROJECT PROGRESS
- [x] Open PDB file
- [X] Meaningfully extract atom variables into efficient data structure
- [X] Implement mathematical computation for total protein internal energy
- [X] Perform protein comparison
- [X] Written report with analysis

# Folder Organization
* `/CRD_File_py_src/` protein internal energy calculation written in python using the professor provided CRD files containing pre-fetched atom variables
* `/PDB_File_py_src/` protein internal energy calculation written in python using self-provided atom variables
* `/data/` contains pdb and crd files 
* `/Results/` contains the CSV files which have been generated by scoreCompareMain.py . More details regarding these files is included in the readme.md file within the Results folder.
* `/Share/` contains the Written Report (PDF and DOCX) and Rough Interface along with any supplemental files.


#PLEASE NOTE:- Depending on where you save the files you will have to change the file path in main.py in the PDB_File_py_src folder


# Run time tests

Run with python:

# `/PDB_File_py_src/` Environment Set Up
## Windows
download https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py
```shell
python get-pip.py
```

## MSYS2
```shell
pacman -S python3-pip
```

## MacOS
```shell
sudo easy_install pip
sudo pip install --upgrade pip
```

## Get Libraries
```shell
pip install biopython
```

# `/PDB_File_py_src/` Prints each atom in the protein
Use python 3
```shell
cd PDB_File_py_src
python main.py
```


# Run Program to Compute Structure Energy/Metric/Score
Use python 3
```shell
cd CRD_File_py_src
python main.py
```

Please use main.py in CRD_File_py_src to obtain the energy for both conformations of the protein
